👋 Hi, I’m @peter1zhang

👀 I’m interested in machine learning, data science, and open-source development. I love the idea of contributing to projects that have the potential to make a significant impact in the world.

🌱 I’m currently learning about natural language processing and how to use deep learning techniques for text analysis. I'm also brushing up on my Python and getting familiar with new data visualization tools.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging projects related to AI or data science. I'm also open to contributing to open-source projects that are aiming to make a difference in these fields.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email at zhangpeter583@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn]
